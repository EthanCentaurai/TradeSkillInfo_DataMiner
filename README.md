## The Quick Intro

This is a datamining tool used to gather professions data from WoWhead and Buffed.de to use in TradeSkillInfo.

Run `go.bat` or `mine.sh` to begin mining.  The miner will then go through each profession and recipe one by one gathering information and export the results to a `Data.lua` file, which can then be moved into the main TradeSkillInfo addon directory.

The code is pretty terrible but it works.  Suggestions and improvements are welcome and encouraged.

Requires JDK 8.
